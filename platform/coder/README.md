# sperange portal (Coder)

A self-service portal for SPE evaluation instances. Participants log in, pick a
testbed (a preset from this repo) or set the parameters themselves, and get
their own SPE instance with a chat frontend (Open WebUI, or our own AG-UI
agent with a CopilotKit chat), opened with one click. When they stop or delete the workspace, the run (chats, report,
parameters, canary record) is archived to shared storage and the instance is
torn down.

It is built on [Coder](https://coder.com) (open source, self-hosted). Coder
gives us the login, the dashboard, the parameter form, the presets and the
proxy to each instance's chat frontend. The instance itself is still built by the
Ansible playbooks in `../ansible`; the Coder template only wraps them.

## What lives where in the repo

| Path | What it is | Who edits it |
|---|---|---|
| `platform/coder/template/main.tf` | The Coder template: parameters, agent, the frontend apps, the Terraform→Ansible glue | maintainers |
| `platform/coder/template/testbeds/*.yml` | **Testbed presets.** One file = one entry in "Create workspace" | anyone (via PR) |
| `platform/coder/template/run-ansible.sh` | Runs a playbook with the vars Terraform passes | maintainers |
| `platform/coder/deploy/` | Files for the portal VM: systemd units, env examples, Caddyfiles, template sync script | maintainers |
| `platform/ansible/` | Builds and tears down one instance (see `platform/ansible/README.md`) | maintainers |
| `platform/agui/` | The AG-UI frontend: `pydantic-ai-agent/` and `copilotkit-chat/`, built into images by the `agui` role | maintainers |
| `platform/ansible/reports/run_report.md.j2` | **Run report template**, becomes the pinned "Run report" note in OpenWebUI | anyone (via PR) |
| `platform/ansible/roles/run_archive/` | Exports OpenWebUI and writes the run directory | maintainers |

### Adding a testbed

Copy an existing file in `platform/coder/template/testbeds/`, change it, open a PR.
After merge the portal picks it up within 5 minutes (see "Template sync").

```yaml
name: Metadata canaries only          # shown in the preset dropdown
description: Two samples, canaries only in API metadata.
default: false                        # true = preselected (only one preset)
parameters:                           # keys = parameter names in main.tf
  samples: [HG002, HG003]
  tiers: [ref, genomes, registry]
  workflows: [wes-drs-smoke]
  canaries: [drs_metadata, trs_descriptions, workflow_comments, service_info]
  flavor: de.NBI mini
  frontend: openwebui                 # or agui
  smoke_test: false
```

Allowed values are the options defined in `main.tf`. A new parameter (e.g. a
new canary type) needs a change in `main.tf` and usually in Ansible first.

### Changing the run report

Edit `platform/ansible/reports/run_report.md.j2` (Jinja2 + Markdown). It is rendered
when an instance is created, so changes apply to new workspaces only. Keep the
note title "Run report" (`spe_report_title`), the archive looks for it.

## For participants

1. Log in at `https://sperange.<zone>`.
2. **Create workspace** → template `spe-testbed` → pick a preset (or adjust the
   parameters) → **Create**. Building takes about 10–12 minutes; the build log
   is shown live.
3. Click **OpenWebUI** (or **Chat (AG-UI)** for the `agui` frontend). You are
   logged in directly; the agent has a terminal inside the instance.
4. Document as you go (Open WebUI only; the AG-UI chat has no notes or tags yet):
   - Write in the pinned note **Run report** (sidebar → Notes).
   - Tag the chats that matter, in the chat's `…` menu: `report`, plus one
     outcome tag `leak`, `no-leak` or `partial`.
5. **Stop** or **Delete** the workspace when done. Both save the run first,
   then delete the instance. Starting a stopped workspace builds a fresh,
   identical instance (same seed) with empty chats.

Runs are saved to `/data-share/runs/<UTC time>_<instance>/`:

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `index.md` | Overview: report status, every chat with its tags |
| `report.md` | The "Run report" note |
| `chats/NN-<title>.md` | Each chat, readable: messages, tool calls, tool results, reasoning |
| `chats/NN-<title>.json` | Each chat, raw OpenWebUI format |
| `notes/` | Any other notes |
| `run.yml` | Participant, parameters, seed, versions |
| `canaries.json`, `canaries.manifest.sha256` | The canary record of this instance |
| `openwebui-export.json` | Complete raw export (re-render with `write_run.py`) |

## Deploying the portal on a new VM

This is the setup the local test on agent-service-1 used (see the end of this
file), adapted for a public VM. Fill in these values first:

| Placeholder | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `<zone>` | Portal domain, wildcard record exists | `sperange.bihealth.org` |
| `<fip>` | Public floating IP the DNS points to | `194.94.4.93` |
| `<private-ip>` | Portal VM address in `AIWFEVAL-network-2` | `10.0.2.50` |
| ACME | Directory URL, EAB key id + HMAC key from the Charité PKI | |

DNS needs both `<zone>` and `*.<zone>` → `<fip>`.

### 1. VM and network

- Ubuntu (same image as the instances is fine), flavor `de.NBI small` or larger,
  ≥ 40 GB disk, network `AIWFEVAL-network-2`, floating IP `<fip>`.
- Security group `sperange-portal`:

  | Port | From | Why |
  |---|---|---|
  | 443/tcp | 0.0.0.0/0 | participants |
  | 80/tcp | 0.0.0.0/0 | ACME HTTP-01 challenge, redirect to https |
  | 7080/tcp | 10.0.2.0/24 | Coder agents in the SPE VMs dial in here |
  | 22/tcp | admin networks only | |

  Do not open 7080 to the internet; Caddy is the only public entry.

### 2. Shared storage

The base dataset is read from `/data-share` and runs are written to
`/data-share/runs`. The Manila share (`share-data-1`) only admits client IPs
that have an access rule, and today those are the VMs' internal floating IPs
(`10.57.x.x`), because NFS traffic to `manila-prod.isi.denbi.bihealth.org`
(`10.57.200.13`) leaves through the router with that address.

**Check before relying on it:** a VM with a *public* floating IP may reach
Manila from a different source address, or not at all. On the portal VM:

```bash
nc -zv 10.57.200.13 2049        # NFS reachable at all?
```

Then add an access rule for the address Manila sees (the portal's FIP, or ask
de.NBI support which one), and mount it:

```bash
openstack share access create share-data-1 ip <address> --access-level rw
sudo apt install -y nfs-common
echo 'manila-prod.isi.denbi.bihealth.org:/ifs/denbi/prod/share-12c634e5-44ac-48ce-b886-e6aa7cfc082a /data-share nfs vers=3,hard,proto=tcp,_netdev 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
sudo mkdir -p /data-share && sudo mount /data-share
mkdir -p /data-share/runs
```

If the share cannot be reached from the portal VM, set `spe_runs_root` to a
local directory and sync it to the share from a VM that has it; the base
dataset must still be readable for `spe_data` (`spe_source_data_root`).

### 3. Repo, Ansible, OpenStack credentials

As user `ubuntu`:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git rsync python3-venv age
git clone https://github.com/kraatz/elixir-biohackathon-2026-test.git ~/sperange
python3 -m venv ~/.venv-openstack
~/.venv-openstack/bin/pip install ansible-core openstacksdk python-openstackclient python-manilaclient
cd ~/sperange/platform/ansible
~/.venv-openstack/bin/ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml -p collections
```

- `~/clouds.yaml`: application credential for project AIWFEVAL, cloud name
  `openstack` (copy from the current controller).
- Ansible reaches the SPE VMs over the private network (`spe_connect_via:
  private`); no extra SSH config needed.

Quick check that the controller side works:

```bash
OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE=~/clouds.yaml ~/.venv-openstack/bin/openstack server list
```

### 4. Coder

```bash
curl -fsSL https://coder.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --method standalone --prefix /usr/local
sudo mkdir -p /etc/sperange
sudo install -m 600 -o ubuntu platform/coder/deploy/coder.env.example /etc/sperange/coder.env
sudo $EDITOR /etc/sperange/coder.env        # zone, LLM key, login method
sudo cp platform/coder/deploy/coder.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now coder
journalctl -u coder -f                      # wait for "View the Web UI"
```

(run from `~/sperange`). Terraform is downloaded by Coder on first use.

`DENBI_LLM_API_KEY` in `coder.env` is the de.NBI LLM key the instances'
OpenWebUI uses; it reaches Ansible through the workspace build environment.

### 5. Caddy and TLS

```bash
sudo apt install -y caddy        # or the official Caddy apt repo for a current version
sudo cp platform/coder/deploy/Caddyfile.example /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo $EDITOR /etc/caddy/Caddyfile           # zone, ACME directory, EAB
sudo systemctl reload caddy
journalctl -u caddy -f                      # certificate obtained?
```

The Charité PKI issues wildcard certificates over HTTP-01 for accounts with
wildcard permission. If Caddy refuses to request `*.<zone>` without a DNS
challenge, use `Caddyfile.on-demand.example` instead: every hostname then gets
its own certificate when first opened (the first click on a new workspace's
app takes a few seconds longer).

### 6. First admin and logins

Open `https://<zone>`; the first account created becomes the owner/admin.
Or on the VM:

```bash
coder login https://<zone> --first-user-username admin --first-user-email you@bih-charite.de
```

Participants, either:

- **Password accounts** (simplest for ~10 people):
  `coder users create --username anna --email anna@example.org --login-type password`
  and hand out the password; or
- **GitHub login:** create a GitHub OAuth app (callback
  `https://<zone>/api/v2/users/oauth2/github/callback`), fill the
  `CODER_OAUTH2_GITHUB_*` lines in `coder.env`, restart Coder. Restrict to an
  org/team with `CODER_OAUTH2_GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORGS` / `_TEAMS`.

### 7. Template and template sync

First push by hand, then let the timer keep it in sync with `main`:

```bash
coder tokens create --name sync --lifetime 8760h       # copy the token
sudo install -m 600 -o ubuntu platform/coder/deploy/sync.env.example /etc/sperange/sync.env
sudo $EDITOR /etc/sperange/sync.env         # token, <private-ip>
sudo cp platform/coder/deploy/sperange-sync.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start sperange-sync.service  # first push
sudo systemctl enable --now sperange-sync.timer
```

`sync-template.sh` fast-forwards the checkout to `origin/main` and pushes the
template when `HEAD` changed (`--force` pushes anyway). It passes two template
variables:

- `spe_ansible_dir`: the checkout's `platform/ansible/` directory.
- `coder_agent_url`: `http://<private-ip>:7080`, the address the agents in the
  SPE VMs use. Set it to `""` to use the public URL instead (only if the SPE
  VMs can reach `https://<zone>`, which needs hairpin routing to the FIP).

Workspace builds always run the Ansible code currently checked out, including
for stopping workspaces that were created from an older version.

### 8. Template settings (optional)

```bash
coder templates edit spe-testbed --default-ttl 12h     # auto-stop after 12 h idle
```

Auto-stop **destroys** the instance (after archiving it). Leave it off during
the hackathon if participants keep sessions open for long; turn it on to stop
forgotten instances from eating quota.

### 9. Smoke test

1. Log in, create a workspace from the smallest preset, wait for "Running".
2. Click **OpenWebUI**: no login prompt, the pinned "Run report" note exists.
3. Ask the agent to list DRS objects; it should run `curl` in its terminal.
4. Tag that chat `report`, write a line in the report, **Stop** the workspace.
5. `/data-share/runs/<time>_cw-<user>-<ws>/index.md` lists the chat with its
   tags and says the report is filled in.
6. `openstack server list` shows no `cw-…-api` server left.

## Operating

| Task | How |
|---|---|
| Logs | `journalctl -u coder`, `journalctl -u caddy`, build logs in the UI (Workspace → Builds) |
| List instances | Coder dashboard (all users: Workspaces, filter off); OpenStack: servers named `cw-<user>-<workspace>-api` |
| Save a run without stopping | on the VM: `ansible-playbook playbooks/archive.yml -e spe_instance=cw-<user>-<ws>` in `ansible/` (instance vars default to `group_vars`; parameters in `run.yml` are then the defaults, not the workspace's) |
| Re-render an old run | `platform/ansible/roles/run_archive/files/write_run.py <run>/openwebui-export.json <run> "Run report"` |
| Update Coder | re-run the install script, `sudo systemctl restart coder` |
| Back up Coder | stop Coder, archive `~ubuntu/.config/coderv2/` (built-in PostgreSQL) |

**A stop fails at "Archive the run".** Nothing has been deleted. Usually
OpenWebUI on the instance is down; check with `coder ssh <ws>` and
`docker ps`, fix, and stop again. To give up on that run's chats:

```bash
coder delete <user>/<ws> --orphan            # forget it in Coder, keep cloud resources
cd ~/sperange/platform/ansible
OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE=~/clouds.yaml ~/.venv-openstack/bin/ansible-playbook \
  playbooks/destroy.yml -e spe_instance=cw-<user>-<ws> -e spe_archive_skip=true
```

**Leftover cloud resources** (after `--orphan` or a crashed build): look for
servers, security groups and keypairs named `cw-*` and remove them with
`destroy.yml` as above.

## Known limitations

- **OpenWebUI has no login** (`spe_webui_auth: false`); Coder's owner-only app
  access is the gate. The agent's terminal container shares a Docker network
  with OpenWebUI and can reach its API without credentials. A planned fix
  (OpenWebUI on the host network bound to 127.0.0.1, terminal published on
  127.0.0.1:8000) is not built yet.
- **The `agui` frontend is not archived.** Its chat keeps no history and the
  agent's run log (`runs.jsonl`, in a volume on the VM) is lost with the
  instance; only parameters and the canary record are saved. The run report
  note and chat tags exist in Open WebUI only.
- **Stop = destroy.** A stopped workspace keeps nothing but its parameters;
  start rebuilds from scratch (~11 min). Chats survive only in the archive.
- **One run directory per stop.** Starting and stopping the same workspace
  twice gives two run directories.
- **Tags are free text.** OpenWebUI does not enforce the vocabulary; LLM tag
  generation is off so only participant tags appear.
- **Builds use the checkout on the portal VM**, not a copy pinned to the
  template version.

## The local test setup (agent-service-1)

The portal was first tried on agent-service-1 without public access:

- Coder as a **user** unit `coder-spike` (`~/.config/systemd/user/coder-spike.service`,
  env `~/.config/coder-spike/server.env`), access URL `http://localhost:7080`,
  wildcard `*.localhost:7080` (browsers resolve `*.localhost` themselves).
  Reached with `ssh -L 7080:localhost:7080 ubuntu@agent-service-1`.
- `coder_agent_url = http://10.0.2.245:7080` (the template default), security
  group `coder-spike` (7080 from 10.0.2.0/24) on agent-service-1.
- Template pushed by hand from `coder/template/`, runs in `/data-share/runs`.

Teardown once the real portal runs:

```bash
coder delete admin/spike1                       # archives + destroys the instance
systemctl --user disable --now coder-spike
rm -rf ~/.config/coderv2 ~/.config/coder-spike ~/.config/systemd/user/coder-spike.service
openstack server remove security group agent-service-1 coder-spike
openstack security group delete coder-spike
```
