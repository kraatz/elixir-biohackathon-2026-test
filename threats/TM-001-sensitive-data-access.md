# TM-001: Sensitive Data Access During Pipeline Reasoning

## Description

While executing the requested pipeline, the agent reads, modifies, or deletes
private data and may expose it in its output. The agent's legitimate reasoning
process becomes the vehicle for unauthorized data access.

## Affected Assets

Sensitive/private data accessible to the agent, e.g. user records,
credentials, and internal documents.

## Threat Categories (STRIDE)

- **Information Disclosure**: reading and exposing sensitive data in the
  chat output.
- **Tampering**: modifying or deleting the data during pipeline execution.

## Attack Scenarios

1. **Malicious user prompt**: a user directly prompts the agent to access
   sensitive data and return it in the chat.
2. **Indirect prompt injection**: instructions embedded in documents or tool
   outputs processed during the pipeline cause the agent to access or leak
   the data without the user asking directly.

## Preconditions

- The agent has read (and/or write/delete) access to the sensitive data store.
- No output filtering or data-loss-prevention layer exists between the agent
  and the output channel.
- User input is passed to the agent without restriction on data-access
  requests.

## Mitigations

### Preventive

- Least privilege: do not grant the agent access to sensitive data it does
  not need.
- Credential scoping: limit credentials to only what the pipeline requires.

### Detective

- Monitoring of user prompts and agent outputs (governance / DLP tooling).
- Logging of all data-access operations performed by the agent.

### Responsive

- Credential revocation on detection of unauthorized access.
- Session quarantine and incident escalation.
